# Question 1 — User Identity Verification

## Task
**Display your currently logged-in username and all groups your user account belongs to.**  
✅ Your name/login ID must appear in the output.

---

## What I did
I used:
- `whoami` to print the currently logged-in username
- `groups` to print all groups my user belongs to  
(Optional alternative: `id` shows both in one command.)

---

## Commands
```bash
whoami
groups

# Optional (single command)
id
